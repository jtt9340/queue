Here are some suggestions for how to improve this app:

- Make it expandable. Right now, the app will keep track of people waiting in
line for a 3D printer. Make it so that people can create their own events and
have it track multiple queues, one for each event, at a time.

- Have it give a time estimate for how long a print will take.

- Automatically notify the head of the line when a 3D print is done.

- Notify someone when they have been at the front of the line for more than a day.

- Allow admins to rearrange people in the queue.

- Break the Queue struct up: right now it holds which people in line, and it also
holds information related to the Slack API, e.g. mapping Slack channel IDs to channel
names, etc. This could probably be broken up into two different structs: one that holds
the VecDeque structure and knows nothing about the Slack API, and one that just forwards
all "add", "remove", etc. commands to the Queue struct and just handles interacting with
the Slack API.
