Here are some suggestions for how to improve this app:

- Make it expandable. Right now, the app will keep track of people waiting in
line for a 3D printer. Make it so that people can create their own events and
have it track multiple queues, one for each event, at a time.

- Have it give a time estimate for how long a print will take.

- Automatically notify the head of the line when a 3D print is done.

- Notify someone when they have been at the front of the line for more than a day.
